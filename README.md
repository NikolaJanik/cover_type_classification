# Cover type classification


The project concerns classification of forest cover type from cartographic variables only using classical machine learning methods and neural networks.

The repository contains:
1. code written in python in which models are trained: cover_type.ipynb
2. files containing data from the process of finding optimal hyperparameters for Neural Networks: history_training_balanced_data.pkl and history_training_unbalanced_data.pkl
3. files with trained models: dummy_best.joblib, decision_tree_best.joblib, random_forest_best.joblib and neural_network_best.h5
4. deployment proposal using Flask and Docker.
