# Cover type classification


The project concerns classification of forest cover type from cartographic variables using classical machine learning methods and neural networks.

The repository contains:
1. Python script in which models are trained: cover_type.py
2. Jupyter Notebook in which models are trained: cover_type.ipynb
3. Files containing data from the process of finding optimal hyperparameters for Neural Networks: history_training_balanced_data.pkl and history_training_unbalanced_data.pkl
4. Files with trained models: dummy_best.joblib, decision_tree_best.joblib, random_forest_best.joblib and neural_network_best.h5
5. Deployment proposal using Flask: flask_script.py
6. Dockerfile which was needed to create a Docker image
7. requirement.txt which was needed to create a Docker image
